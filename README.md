## Usage

To use Music-Ball, follow these steps:

1. Convert your music file to the MIDI format using any software or online tool that supports MIDI conversion. Make sure the MIDI file represents the song you want to visualize.
2. Copy the converted MIDI file to the project's directory.
3. Open the project in Unity.
4. In the Unity Editor, locate the `SongFormatter.cs` script and open it.
5. Go to line 12 in the script and modify the file path to match the name and location of your MIDI file.
6. Save the changes and close the script.
7. Run the game within the Unity Editor or build it for your desired platform.
